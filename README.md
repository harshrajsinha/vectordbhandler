# vectordbhandler
Vector DB handler to connect and use different  vector db using python

A vector database is a specific kind of database that saves information in the form of multi-dimensional vectors representing certain characteristics or qualities.

The number of dimensions in each vector can vary widely, from just a few to several thousand, based on the data's intricacy and detail. This data, which could include text, images, audio, and video, is transformed into vectors using various processes like machine learning models, word embeddings, or feature extraction techniques.

The primary benefit of a vector database is its ability to swiftly and precisely locate and retrieve data according to their vector proximity or resemblance. This allows for searches rooted in semantic or contextual relevance rather than relying solely on exact matches or set criteria as with conventional databases.
